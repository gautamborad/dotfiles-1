dotfiles
========

My configuration. Mostly used on OSX.


emacs.d/
vim/
        Most of my work happens in Emacs. Config for programming
        languages, and org-mode stuff. I don't use vim so much these
        days and have a minimal config.

nix/
nixpkgs/
        The nixpkgs submodule is the specific commit I'm using nix
        from -- which is probably some version of
        nixos-unstable. There is some outdated NixOS config, and my
        main config is at nix/nixpkgs/config.nix.
