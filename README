mjhoy/dotfiles
==============

  My configuration.

  I'm currently working primarily on my emacs config [1].

  There's also some Haskell, Ruby, git, and bash configuration.

  I mostly run this on my Mac OS X machine, and have begun to test on
  a linux system (arch).


Development
-----------

  Make sure to clone with `--recursive` to check out the submodules.

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/mjhoy/dotfiles.git


Install
-------

  Running the install ruby script creates the actual dotfiles in $HOME
  as symbolic links.

    $ ruby ./install
