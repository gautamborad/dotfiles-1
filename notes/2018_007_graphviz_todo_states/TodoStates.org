#+TITLE: Todo States
#+startup: inlineimages

Two things. 1: I'd like a directed graph describing my TODO states I
use in [[../../emacs.d/lisp/init-org/todo.el][org mode]].

B: I'd like to have org mode generate the file and show it inline in a
pretty way.

Solution. BEGIN_SRC block, use =dot= type, make sure you've required
ob-dot, set an output file, you're good to go.

Bonus, set =#+startup:inlineimages= at the top of your org file, and
that image link that gets generated is rendered inline. However to
keep it refreshed you need to [[https://github.com/mjhoy/dotfiles/commit/4a9766cd348e37da6606b7a0e74389c05521ca64][add a hook]] to redisplay them.

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file todo_states.png :cmdline -Tpng
  digraph {
    todo -> next -> done
    todo -> wait
    todo -> hold
    wait -> cancelled
    hold -> cancelled
    wait -> todo
    hold -> todo
  }
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:todo_states.png]]
